## The `forEach` function

### Before starting: 
    - Install all dependencies with `npm install`
    - Run your tests in the terminal with `npm t` or `yarn test`
    - Optionally, you can run the tests in watch mode with `npm t -- --watch` or `yarn test --watch`

### Todo

- [ ] Implement the `forEach` function in the `src/09-forEach.js`file
- [ ] The `forEach` function takes a collection of element and a callback as parameter. 
  It will call the given callback function by passing the following arguments: 
    - the current item of the collection
    - its position in the collection and the collection itself. 
    - This function does not return anything.


### Important note:
You cannot modify the tests suites. If you find an issue, please, let us know via email (007@hackages.io) or via the platform. 

The goal of these exercises is to teach you how to write code in JavaScript as you will in real world projects.
